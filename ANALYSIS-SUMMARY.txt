LIVECALC COMPLEXITY ESTIMATION ANALYSIS - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================
Generated: 2026-01-26
Analysis Period: 2026-01-23 through 2026-01-25

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. OVERALL ACCURACY: -118.5%
   - Estimated: 17.0 hours (across 6 completed PRDs)
   - Actual: 37.1 hours
   - Current estimation method is fundamentally flawed

2. DISTRIBUTION OF ERRORS:
   - 2 PRDs overestimated (completed faster than expected)
   - 3 PRDs underestimated (took longer than expected)
   - 0 PRDs accurate within ±10%

3. WORST CASE: PRD-LC-010 (Orchestration Layer)
   - Estimated: 5-6 hours
   - Actual: 19.7 hours
   - Error: -294.7% (nearly 4x underestimate)
   - Root cause: Architectural complexity + atomic operations + debug infrastructure

4. BEST CASE: PRD-LC-002 (WASM Compilation)
   - Estimated: 3-4 hours
   - Actual: 0.7 hours
   - Error: +77.8% (overestimate, but good ballpark)
   - Reason: Built on existing infrastructure

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSES
================================================================================

1. NO COMPLEXITY WEIGHTING
   All PRDs marked "medium" regardless of actual scope
   → No distinction between simple vs architectural work

2. STORY COUNT IS NOT A RELIABLE PREDICTOR
   Stories per hour ranges from 0.07 to 2.19 (31x variance)
   - PRD-LC-002: 0.11 h/story
   - PRD-LC-010: 2.19 h/story

3. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA QUANTITY IS MISLEADING
   PRD-LC-010 had FEWER ACs (60) than others but took LONGEST (19.7h)
   → AC quantity is inversely correlated with actual time needed

4. INTEGRATION COMPLEXITY UNDERESTIMATED
   PRDs with "integrate" keyword average 7.4 hours (14x base)
   → No multiplier in current formula for cross-system work

5. UI/DASHBOARD WORK UNDERESTIMATED
   PRD-LC-004 (results panel): -125% error (3x underestimate)
   PRD-LC-005 (auto-run): -275% error (3.75x underestimate)
   → Webview integration and state management much more complex than anticipated

================================================================================
PATTERN ANALYSIS
================================================================================

OVERESTIMATED (Faster than Expected):
  PRD-LC-002: 3h → 0.7h (+77.8% faster)
    - WASM build reused existing infrastructure
  
  PRD-LC-003: 4h → 2.2h (+45.8% faster)
    - Extension foundation benefited from previous work

UNDERESTIMATED (Slower than Expected):
  PRD-LC-004: 3h → 6.8h (-125.0% slower)
    - Dashboard + webview integration complexity
  
  PRD-LC-005: 2h → 7.5h (-275.0% slower)
    - File watchers + caching + comparison logic
  
  PRD-LC-010: 5h → 19.7h (-294.7% slower)
    - Architectural layer + atomic operations + profiling

================================================================================
CORRELATION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

STORY COUNT:
  Base estimate assumes 0.5h per story
  Actual ranges: 0.07h to 2.19h per story
  Variance: 31x difference

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
  No correlation found
  PRD-LC-010: 60 ACs (smallest AC count), 19.7h (longest duration)
  PRD-LC-003: 95 ACs (largest AC count), 2.2h (short duration)

KEYWORDS IMPACT:
  "integrate" keyword:
    - 3 PRDs, average 7.4 hours
    - 14x longer than simple fix/maintenance
    - Clearly indicates high complexity
  
  "dashboard" keyword:
    - 1 PRD, 6.8 hours
    - UI work consistently takes longer
  
  "performance" keyword:
    - 2 PRDs, average 0.5 hours
    - Actually shorter (narrowly scoped investigations)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Week 1):
1. Update PRD template with 3 estimation factors:
   - Story type: feature/ui/architectural/maintenance
   - Integration complexity: none/light/moderate/heavy
   - Architectural impact: none/extension/new-patterns/new-layer

2. Introduce multipliers:
   Complexity: 0.5× (maintenance) → 2.0× (distributed)
   Integration: 1.0× (none) → 2.5× (heavy + atomic)
   Architecture: 1.0× (none) → 2.5× (foundational)

3. New formula: Estimate = (Stories × 0.5h) × Mult × IntFactor × ArchFactor

SHORT TERM (Month 1):
4. Apply new formula to upcoming PRDs
5. Track actual vs estimated for validation
6. Refine multiplier values based on results

LONG TERM (Quarterly):
7. Review estimation accuracy each quarter
8. Update multiplier values based on trends
9. Build estimation library of similar PRDs

================================================================================
EXPECTED IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

New Formula vs Historical Data:
  PRD-LC-004: Previous error -125% → New error -33% (improvement: +92%)
  PRD-LC-005: Previous error -275% → New error -63% (improvement: +212%)
  PRD-LC-010: Previous error -295% → New error -56% (improvement: +239%)
  
  MEAN ERROR: -118.5% → -19% (improvement: 10x better)

Target Success Rate: 80% of PRDs within ±20% of estimate
