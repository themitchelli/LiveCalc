# SKIP: US-STD-05 AC-17 - Coverage Not a Hard Requirement

## Acceptance Criterion
Not a hard requirement: prefer meaningful tests over coverage percentage

## Why Not Testable

This criterion is a **philosophical guideline** about test quality:

1. **Subjective judgment**: "Meaningful tests" requires human interpretation
2. **Guidance, not rule**: This is about mindset, not a measurable outcome
3. **Cannot verify nuance**: Shell tests cannot determine if this philosophy is properly communicated

## Alternative Verification

Manual review to confirm the document mentions:
- Coverage is a target, not an absolute requirement
- Quality tests are more valuable than hitting coverage numbers
