# SKIP: US-STD-02 AC-12 - No Conflicting Guidance

## Acceptance Criterion
No conflicting guidance with other standards files

## Why Not Testable

This criterion requires **semantic understanding** of the content across multiple files:

1. **Subjective interpretation**: What constitutes "conflicting" guidance depends on context
2. **Cross-reference analysis**: Requires understanding relationships between statements
3. **Domain expertise needed**: Some apparent conflicts may be intentional nuances

## Alternative Verification

Manual review should check:
- TypeScript naming in coding.md matches references in FADE.md
- Error handling guidance is consistent across api-security.md and coding.md
- No contradictory statements about SIMD alignment, CalcEngine interface, etc.
