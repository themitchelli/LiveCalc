# SKIP: US-005 AC-14 - Results panel opens/updates on completion (see PRD-LC-004)

## Acceptance Criterion
Results panel opens/updates on completion (see PRD-LC-004)

## Reason for Skipping
This acceptance criterion explicitly references a future PRD:

1. **Future Work**: PRD-LC-004 is the Results Panel Visualization PRD
2. **Not Yet Implemented**: The results panel feature is planned for a separate PRD
3. **TODO in Code**: The run.ts file contains `// TODO: Open results panel (PRD-LC-004)`

## Alternative Verification
- This will be tested when PRD-LC-004 is implemented
- Currently the run command completes without opening a results panel
- The feature is intentionally deferred to PRD-LC-004
